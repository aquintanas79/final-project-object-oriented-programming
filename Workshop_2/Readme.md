## Domotic Circuit Simulator – Software Requirements

## Overview

This section of the repository provides a summary of the conceptual and technical design of the Domotic Circuit Simulator, including the system architecture, main components, and the object-oriented approach guiding its development.

## Content 

- Conceptual design updates: improvements in class organization, implementation of encapsulation, and enhancements to the user experience.
- Technical design (UML): class and sequence diagrams that outline the essential structure and behavior of the system.
- OOP implementation plan: application of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to ensure modularity, maintainability, and scalability.
- Project structure: organization of the codebase into to clearly separate responsibilities.
- Initial Python snippets: foundational class templates that illustrate the initial structure of the simulator.

## Purpose

The objective of this section is to provide a concise and clear reference of the simulator’s architecture and design direction, supporting both understanding and future development of the project.

**Domotic Circuit Simulator â€“ Software Requirements**

**Overview**

This section corresponds to the initial phase of the Domotic Circuit Simulator project, where the software requirements and the basic elements for its development are defined.
Here, the information necessary to understand what the system should do, how it should function, and how it is expected to interact with the user is presented.

**Content**

- Functional and non-functional requirements: describe the main functions of the simulator and its quality characteristics.
- User stories: specify the user's needs.
- Mockups: show the preliminary design of the graphical interface.
- CRC Cards: summarize the main classes of the system, their responsibilities, and collaborations.

**Purpose**

This documentation represents the starting point for project development.
Its objective is to define the scope of the system and serve as the basis for the following stages: design, prototyping, and testing.
